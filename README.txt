Use the sample bash script "run.sh" as a shortcut to execute main using
mpirun. It will be updated as time goes and will continue to be a useful
tool.

This is a first-iteration prototype

As development has transipired, many possible improvements have been noted,
features discussed, and language-implementation techniques discovered. That
being said, our goal was to get it "working" to some extent and then adjust,
replace, maneuver as necessary to continue with the intended modular, scalable
and extensible library of functionality that PCAT provides. 


The following is an incomplete list of possible updates, changes, features,
additions, improvements under consideration

- Move from Python's multiprocessing module to mpi4py.MPE
- Move from PCAT.globals to Python's native globals() control
